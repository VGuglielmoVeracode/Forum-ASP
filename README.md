# Forum-ASP-MySQL
 
The demo website is here http://www.forum.ol.sg

The forum engine is updated from Web Wiz Forums, it's neat, easy to get up and running.

It's developed by ASP + MySQL, deployed on Godaddy.

I have modified some of the features according to my requirements.

The free version of WebWiz comes with some Advertisements, I hidden them which is not recommended.

I also compared and tried other forum engines, WebWiz is the only one that I'm willing to keep using.
